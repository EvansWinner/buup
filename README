THERE ARE STILL SOME SERIOUS BUGS IN BUUP. DO NOT USE.

Buup is a line editor like ed(1) but much smaller and simpler.  It is a single
short c file with no build dependencies other than a c compiler and stdio.h.

It is as fork of Dieter Schoppitsch's minimalistic editor, ATTO
(https://github.com/EvansWinner/atto_line_editor), see which for some more
detail.


Install
-------

At the moment, build with something like

     gcc -Wall -s -O3 -o buup buup.c

Or you can use the makefile and just type

     make

This will build buup with clang and will also make the man(1) page using GNU
groff. 


Use
---

Read the man page.

To do
-----

- Help and version info as command line switches instead of an interactive
  function.
