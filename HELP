Two things are tricky: It's not possible to edit a line directly. Instead the
line is printed and an "edit string" will be read below. - Everything after an
'i' in this string will be inserted in the line. - Everything after an 'd' in
this string will be deleted in the line. - Everything after an 'c' in this
string will be changed in the line. - A 's' in this string splits the line.
Inserting new line(s) after the actual line (command 'i') could be ended with a
'.' in a line itself.
